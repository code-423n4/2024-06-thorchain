👋 Hello and welcome to the audit channel for the $36,500 in USDC **Thorchain** audit!

📆 Audit opens 06/05/2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through 06/12/2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (7 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Thorchain team, particularly @Eridanus (9R), who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread in the EST and PST timezones . 

🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources. 

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

how can the go code can be executed & tested exactly ?


[06/06/2024 12:12] samuraii77
since the audit is focused on the fact that the whitelist of tokens is being removed, we can assume that there is essentially no whitelist and any token is allowed?


[06/06/2024 13:24] iam_emptyset
The whitelist that is being removed is not the allowed tokens it's for the contracts that can interact with the router. Not sure though

[06/06/2024 13:59] olegpetrov
you are right. cc @samuraii77 

Before, only transactions originating from whitelisted contracts would be observed, others could succeed on the evm blockchain, but be ignored by Thorchain.

Having a list of whitelisted smart contracts is making the protocol less composable and is hindering Thorchain's growth. We want any contracts be it aggregators, other protocols or more simply smart contract wallets to be able to interact with the Thorchain Router.


[06/06/2024 14:01] olegpetrov
Will defer to Eridanus for this.

I tested "evil contracts" in the solidity test suite directly, so that's an angle too.

where the router will be deployed?


[06/07/2024 05:00] samuselderg
Wait for confirmation by the team, but pretty sure the evm router is *currently* relevant scope to:
- Ethereum (mainnet)
- BSC (BNB Smartchain)
- Avalanche (AVAX)

But i would assume any highly popular EVM chain may be considered in the future

Again, take the above with a grain of salt, hopefully the team can confirm 🙏

vault address, token address, token amount, trx memo, trx expiration time. Look at the  `depositWithExpiry` function in the `THORChain_Router` contract brother

why the documentation refer to a gas assets those tokens that are put it in the router


[06/07/2024 12:20] tamayonft

[06/07/2024 12:23] 0xshaheen
gas assets probably mean native tokens like ethers on ethereum etc

in order:

`address vault` a currently active thorchain vault (controlled by a TSS)
`address asset` what asset is being deposited (0x0 for ether)
`uint256 amount` the amount of tokens being deposited
`string memo` a thorchain memo (https://dev.thorchain.org/concepts/memos.html)
`uint256 expiry` block.timestamp at which point to revert the tx

Hello ! In THORChain_Router.sol, line 362, why it should not revert ? // add test case if aggregator fails, it should not revert the whole transaction (transferOutAndCallV5 call succeeds)
      // call swapOutV5 with erc20. if the aggregator fails, the transaction should not revert


[06/07/2024 15:36] olegpetrov
this is a design choice where we want the assets to be transferred to the dex aggregation contracts and from their its entirely the aggregator contract's responsibility to manage the funds.

we debated this, but the current design (router V4) simply retries the transaction on failure, until the transaction is dropped.


[06/07/2024 15:53] kartoonjoy

[06/07/2024 16:03] jejebl
So why revert if it's eth (line 323) and don't revert when it's erc20 ?


[06/07/2024 16:07] olegpetrov
where is it reverting for eth?

[06/07/2024 16:09] jejebl
it's not reverting but you send back eth to the owner if the swapoutv5 function fail.


[06/07/2024 16:11] olegpetrov
1. try to execute the aggregation

if #1 fails (many legitimate reasons)

2. send ether to the aggregation contract

if #2 fails (e.g. malicious contract tries to re-enter a router method)

3. then send back the ether to the vault as ether should never be left in the router


[06/07/2024 16:12] olegpetrov
> So why revert if it's eth (line 323) and don't revert when it's erc20 ?

I'm not sure what you mean by this, the transaction is not reverting neither for ether or an erc20

Message to Wardens: As pointed out by several of you, the Bifrost code that is in scope does not currently have all of the Router V5 functionality, which means that aspect of Bifrost is not in scope.

But I will double-check with our technical reviewers.


[06/10/2024 13:16] dontonka
Negative sir on my hand, that text doesn't specifiy this issue. What it means is it's partially in scope because only 2 files from that repo is in scope, but that's all, it doesn't mention nothing about the fact that those 2 files in-scope will require an upgrade to support V5 code from the Router that is in the contest in-scope.

if anyone is curios, you can fund your ETH account:
`docker exec -it docker-ethereum-1 /bin/sh`
then:
`cd data`
then :
`geth attach geth.ipc`
and then:
`web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], to: 'your_address', value: 100000000000000000000})`

In the readme, it is said that `transferOutAndCall calls a whitelisted “aggregator” contract’s swapOut function` . 
Does this mean that those aggregator addresses are being selected in the moment Bitfrost signs the transferOutAndCall() transaction (e.g. after receiving a swap request) ?
Or it means that there is some aggregator whitelist present somewhere ?


[06/12/2024 16:22] eridanus9r
there is a whitelist for aggregators in thornode here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/x/thorchain/aggregators/dex_mainnet_current.go
